        <h2>What is lu rou fan?</h2>
        A taiwanese rice dish with braised pork.
        <br>
        In the old days, eating meat was often a luxury. How does one feed an entire family in the rare moment one has a small piece of pork to work with? You cut it into small pieces, braise it for a long time to create a savory braised meat sauce thatâ€™s bursting with flavor, and mix it with lots of steaming, comforting rice so the whole family can enjoy it. Genius.

            <li>4 hardboiled eggs <em>(peeled, optional)</em></li>
        </ul> 
        <h4>FOR THE SPICES (WRAP EVERYTHING IN CHEESE CLOTH AND TIE WITH KITCHEN STRING):</h4>
        <ul id="spice-list"><li>3 star anise</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>6 cloves</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns</li>
            <li>2 pieces dried tangerine peel</li>
            <li>2 slices fresh ginger</li>
        </UL>
        <h2 class="header instruct">INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough so that the pork will be fully submerged), and blanch the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse clean of any scum, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt and then add the onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for another couple minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be tied in cheese cloth), along with the peeled hardboiled eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. To finish the dish, remove the spice packet and turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally. This process should take about 5-minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but there should still be plenty of it left. Serve over steamed white rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
