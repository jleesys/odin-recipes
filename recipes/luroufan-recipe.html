            <li>4 hardboiled eggs <em>(peeled, optional)</em></li>
        </ul> 
        FOR THE SPICES (WRAP EVERYTHING IN CHEESE CLOTH AND TIE WITH KITCHEN STRING):
        <ul><il>3 star anise</il>
            <il>1 cinnamon stick</il>
            <il>6 cloves</il>
            <il>3 bay leaves</il>
            <il>2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns</il>
            <il>2 piecs dried tangerine peel</il>
            <il>2 slices fresh ginger</il>
        </UL>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough so that the pork will be fully submerged), and blanch the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse clean of any scum, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt and then add the onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for another couple minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be tied in cheese cloth), along with the peeled hardboiled eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. To finish the dish, remove the spice packet and turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally. This process should take about 5-minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but there should still be plenty of it left. Serve over steamed white rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
