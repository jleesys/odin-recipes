    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>7 cloves garlic (sliced)</li>
        <li>3 Thai bird or holland chilies (de-seeded, if desired, and thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork (450g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thin/light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>â…“ cup low sodium chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>Holy basil leaves (about 1 1/2 cups packed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wok over medium high heat, add the oil, shallots and garlic, and fry for 3 minutes. Add the chilies and
            cook for another minute. Crank up the heat to high, and add the ground pork, breaking it up into small bits
            and allowing it to crisp up.
        </li>
        <li>Add the sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Stir-fry for another minute and
            deglaze the pan with the broth or water. Because your pan is over high heat, the liquid should cook off very
            quickly. Add the basil, and stir-fry until wilted. Serve over rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
