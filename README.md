The Odin Project
Project: Recipes

Created a simple website using HTML ONLY (no CSS).
Created a landing/index page with hyperlinks to 3 recipes.
Each webpage has an image and associated text (utilizing headers, unordered/ordered lists, paragraphs, etc).
Developed good practice with Git commands and maintaining a repository on GitHub.
