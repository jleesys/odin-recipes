The Odin Project
<br>Project: Recipes

Created a simple website using HTML ONLY (no CSS).
Created a landing/index page with hyperlinks to 3 recipes.
Each webpage has an image and associated text (utilizing headers, unordered/ordered lists, paragraphs, etc).
Developed good practice with Git commands and maintaining a repository on GitHub.

Thoughts/Questions for pondering and research:
I believe that some of these styling elements, like italics and bold, can also be done using CSS.
I wonder what is the benefit/best practices for using one method over the other.
How do I resize images, and move them to the left of text? Likely covered in CSS.
