UPDATE 2022/08/14
Added CSS styling to index and recipe pages.
Currently practicing flexbox layouts.

Objectives achieved:<br>
Created a simple website using HTML ONLY (no CSS).<br>
Created a landing/index page with hyperlinks to 3 recipes.<br>
Each webpage has an image and associated text (utilizing headers, unordered/ordered lists, paragraphs, etc).<br>
Developed good practice with Git commands and maintaining a repository on GitHub.<br>

Thoughts/Questions for pondering and research:<br>
I believe that some of these styling elements, like italics and bold, can also be done using CSS.<br>
I wonder what is the benefit/best practices for using one method over the other.<br>
How do I resize images, and move them to the left of text? Likely covered in CSS.<br>
